<p>I have been analyzing the submissions to the University of Minnesota Extension’s <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/my-minnesota-woods/count-carbon-your-trees-and-woods">Tree and Woodland Carbon Capture Challenge</a>. The Challenge is an activity that asked Minnesotans to measure trees and woodlands to observe how much carbon they sequester over a year.</p>
<p>The audience that participated in this activity included homeowners and private woodland owners with a love for trees. In total, 26 people measured an individual tree and typed their measurements into a Google Form answering the question “What is the diameter of your tree, measured in inches?”</p>
<p>Here are the responses I received:</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Entries in response to the question: What is the diameter of your tree?</em></p>
</div>
<p>I received answers that mixed decimals and fractions, had different significant digits, and mixed character and numeric values. Needless to say, the data were messy and difficult to immediately analyze.</p>
<p>The take-home message is to be specific about how you ask for data and give good examples of what you expect. I did not do this for the activity, and while the quality of the data were good, it’s taking more time to cleaning and reorganize the data.</p>
<p>I could have used data validation features in the Google Form I provided. I could have gave an example like “Measure and enter data for your tree to the nearest tenth of an inch, for example, enter”10.7" for a tree that is 10.7 inches in diameter at breast height.</p>
<p>Audience matters too. If I asked professional foresters the same question, I would have likely received a data set of diameters measured to the nearest tenth of an inch, without me asking specifically for it.</p>
<p>This activity is a reminder to know your audience when asking for data. Automating a data analysis workflow by using data validations can benefit the data analyst and lead to fewer problems when data are ultimately used to make decisions.</p>
