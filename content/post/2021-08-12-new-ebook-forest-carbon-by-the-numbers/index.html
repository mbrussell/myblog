<p>Now available on Amazon is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CC1WT69"><em>Forest Carbon by the Numbers: Understanding the Hottest Forest Product of the 2020s</em></a>.</p>
<p>Carbon is becoming a highly valued commodity of forests. Trees sequester carbon dioxide and turn it into wood, storing carbon in forests and long-lived forest products for long time periods. Despite the increased recognition of carbon as a natural climate solution and several emerging markets that monetize it, few professionals in forestry and natural resources have a grasp on the amount and extent of forest carbon in the ecosystems they work in.</p>
<p>In <em>Forest Carbon by the Numbers</em>, I share insights and visualizations of the current status and trends in forest carbon and how it impacts the forest products industry.</p>
<p>In <em>Forest Carbon by the Numbers</em>, you will understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminology associated with forest carbon measurements and markets,</li>
<li>How forest carbon is quantified (from individual tree to landscape scales),</li>
<li>How to leverage forest inventory data to understand forest biomass and carbon, and</li>
<li>Trends and future opportunities in forest carbon.</li>
</ul>
