Analysts in the forestry community often turn to growth and yield models to simulate what a forest will look like in the future. Whether it's simulating a forest management treatment or forecasting the effects of a natural disturbance, growth and yield models are required tools for understanding how forests will grow.

Increasingly, growth and yield models are being used to understand forest carbon stocks and stock changes. As we strive to quantify the role of forests in offsetting carbon dioxide emissions, having reliable tools to understand forest dynamics is essential. The use of growth and yield models are also required in many forest carbon programs, for example, the [California Air Resources Board’s Compliance Offset Program](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/compliance-offset-program/compliance-offset-protocols/us-forest-projects/models).   

This post describes two commonly used growth and yield models being used to forecast forest carbon. Both rely on inventory data to forecast forest dynamics and carbon stocks and stock changes into the future. Although one was developed in the US and one in Canada, both models are being used across country boundaries.

## The FVS model
The [Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/fvs/index.shtml) is a model developed by the USDA Forest Service in 1973. The FVS model is an individual tree model that uses lists of trees (e.g., species and tree diameter) to forecast forest growth through time. The model can simulate forest management activities, disturbances, and provide forest carbon and harvested wood products reports. A series of 22 different model variants provide regional differences in forest growth patterns.

There has been a tremendous amount of research and development on the FVS model through time. Their website contains excellent supporting information, video tutorials, and documentation. Although the model was originally developed in the US, here are a few applications of it in Canada:

* An [Acadian variant of FVS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324705922_The_Acadian_Variant_of_the_Forest_Vegetation_Simulator_Continued_development_and_evaluation) is available for Maine and the Canadian Maritime provinces,
* The FVS model has been calibrated for [Ontario's forests](https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=28760), and
 

## The CBM-CFS3 model
The [Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Service 3 (CBM-CFS 3)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/climate-change-adapting-impacts-and-reducing-emissions/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-accounting/carbon-budget-model/13107) is a model developed by the Canadian Forest Service in 2002. The model simulates carbon dynamics following the Good Practice Guidance established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for reporting on carbon stocks and stock changes. The model works on an operational scale and is well suited for landscape-level predictions, but it can also operate at the stand level. Although the model was originally developed by the Canadian Forest Service, it has been applied in the US as well:

* An [analysis in seven US states](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/2021-22-fcwg-learning-exchange-series-modeling-forest-management-and-carbon-a-tool-for-state-wide-planning-and-action) used Forest Inventory and Analysis data in CBM-CFS3 to understand carbon impacts resulting from forest management.
* A recent analysis integrated [CBM-CFS3 with a land use and land cover change model](https://cbmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-022-00201-1) to understand spatially explicit estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. 

As for me, I've been a long time FVS user and am beginning to hear more about applications of CBM-CFS3 as a carbon accounting tool. The following table, a "cheat sheet" of sorts, compares the design, input, and outputs of both models:

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
 tbl_img <- data.frame(
   Attribute = c("Developer/maintainer", "Year developed", "Model type", "How are forested regions specified?", "Time step", "Can forest management and disturbance be analyzed?", "Includes climate change?", "Incorporates uneven-aged stands?", "How is regeneration handled?", "Includes harvested wood products report?", "How does it incorporate carbon?", "Carbon pools tracked"),
   FVS = c("USDA Forest Service", "1973", "Individual tree model; semi-distance independent", "Includes 22 different model variants depending on region.", "Default cycle length is 10 years for most variants.", "Yes", "Yes, but only for Western US with Climate-FVS", "Yes", "A “full” regeneration establishment model is available for some variants in the western US. A “partial” establishment model is available for all other variants and simulates stump sprouting. User can specify information on planting and natural regeneration.", "Yes", "Accounts for carbon stocks and stock changes  with the Fire and Fuels Extension.", "Aboveground biomass, belowground biomass (live and dead coarse roots), dead wood (standing and downed), forest floor (litter and duff), herbs and shrubs."),
   `CBM-CFS3` = c("Canadian Forest Service", "Original model: 1989; CBM-CFS3 model: 2002", "Stand and landscape-level model; distance independent", "Default ecological parameters are provided, but can be modified by the user.", "Annual", "Yes", "No", "No. But user can modify yield curves.", "Following a disturbance, regeneration will occur normally or can be delayed or accelerated due to
planting.", "No", "Accounts for carbon stocks and stock changes in tree biomass and
dead organic matter pools.", "Aboveground biomass, belowground biomass (live coarse and live fine roots), dead wood (standing and downed {on ground and in mineral soil}), litter (includes fine woody debris), soil organic matter.")
 )
 
 tbl_img %>%
   kbl(booktabs = T) %>% 
   kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
   kable_paper(full_width = F)
```

Have you tried using both models, and if so, what are your thoughts on their differences? [Drop me an email](mailto:matt@arbor-analytics.com) and I'd love to learn more.
