<p>Forests and timberlands have long been popular investments that provide returns comparable to other economy-wide measures. The changing private ownership patterns in US forests over the last several decades, as timberlands have been owned or managed by timber investment management organizations or real estate investment trusts, has led to a rise in the benefits of timberland as an investment.</p>
<p>The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) recently posted fourth quarter and annual returns for their <a href="https://www.ncreif.org/data-products/timberland/">Timberland Index</a>, an index representing 464 investment-grade timberland properties with a market value of $24.5 billion. The Index showed a 4.89% return for the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The NCREIF gained 12.9% in 2022, the largest annual increase since at least 2010. Returns from timberland investments can be compared to national economic indicators such as the US 10-year Treasury yield and the S&amp;P 500:</p>

<p>In the last 13 years, the NCREIF Index has averaged a return of 5.2%. The variability of returns observed in the NCREIF Index is lower than returns from the S&amp;P 500, represented by a coefficient of variation of 82.7% for the NCREIF Index and 133% for the S&amp;P 500:</p>

For more history, Daowei Zhang’s excellent book <a href="https://osupress.oregonstate.edu/book/from-backwoods-to-boardrooms">“From Backwoods to Boardrooms”</a> presents a thorough history of timberland ownership in the US, describes the rise of TIMOs and REITs, and discusses the future of investment in timberlands.</p>
