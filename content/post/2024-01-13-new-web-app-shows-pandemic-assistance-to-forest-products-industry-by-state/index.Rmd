Forest products companies used the [Paycheck Protection Program](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program) (PPP) and [Pandemic Assistance for Timber Harvesters and Haulers](https://www.farmers.gov/archived/coronavirus/pandemic-assistance/pathh) (PATHH) programs to keep nearly 500,000 workers in the US forest industry on payroll throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A [new web application](https://matt-arbor.shinyapps.io/forestry_pandemic/) is now available that summarizes these pandemic assistance programs and funding provided to each individual state.
 

[You can access the web app here.](https://matt-arbor.shinyapps.io/forestry_pandemic/)

The app uses data presented in the paper [A summary of COVID-19 pandemic assistance to US forest products companies**](https://meridian.allenpress.com/fpj/article/72/4/253/488883/A-Summary-of-COVID-19-Pandemic-Assistance-to-US), published in the *Forest Products Journal* in late 2022. Values include:

* Number of loans/payments offered to forest products companies,
* Average loan/payment amounts,
* Total value of loans/payment provided to state,
* Average number of forest products jobs supported per loan,
* Total number of forest products jobs supported in state,
* Average gross revenue lost in 2020 per business, and
* Total gross revenue lost by state in 2020

Data for the PPP and PATHH programs are presented for each US state plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
