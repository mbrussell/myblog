<p>Forest products companies used the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program">Paycheck Protection Program</a> (PPP) and <a href="https://www.farmers.gov/archived/coronavirus/pandemic-assistance/pathh">Pandemic Assistance for Timber Harvesters and Haulers</a> (PATHH) programs to keep nearly 500,000 workers in the US forest industry on payroll throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A <a href="https://matt-arbor.shinyapps.io/forestry_pandemic/">new web application</a> is now available that summarizes these pandemic assistance programs and funding provided to each individual state.</p>
<p><a href="https://matt-arbor.shinyapps.io/forestry_pandemic/">You can access the web app here.</a></p>
<p>The app uses data presented in the paper <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/fpj/article/72/4/253/488883/A-Summary-of-COVID-19-Pandemic-Assistance-to-US">A summary of COVID-19 pandemic assistance to US forest products companies**</a>, published in the <em>Forest Products Journal</em> in late 2022. Values include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of loans/payments offered to forest products companies,</li>
<li>Average loan/payment amounts,</li>
<li>Total value of loans/payment provided to state,</li>
<li>Average number of forest products jobs supported per loan,</li>
<li>Total number of forest products jobs supported in state,</li>
<li>Average gross revenue lost in 2020 per business, and</li>
<li>Total gross revenue lost by state in 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Data for the PPP and PATHH programs are presented for each US state plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.</p>
