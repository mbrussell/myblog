<p>Carbon may be regarded as the most highly coveted forest product of the 2020â€™s. A benefit of trees is that they store and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making forests a natural climate solution.</p>
<p>While foresters are familiar with measuring the number of boards and cords in a forest, less is known about how much carbon is found in an acre of woods. With a number of emerging markets that seek to pay landowners for the carbon in their trees, an increased understanding of the concepts and numbers behind forest carbon is needed.</p>
<p>This presentation provides several tips and resources for foresters and other natural resource professionals for integrating forest carbon in their work.</p>
