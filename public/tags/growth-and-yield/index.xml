      <description>Analysts in the forestry community often turn to models to simulate what a forest will look like in the future. Whether itâ€™s simulating a forest management treatment or forecasting the effects of a natural disturbance, models are required tools for understanding how forests will grow.
Increasingly, models are being used to understand forest carbon stocks and stock changes. As we strive to quantify the role of forests in offsetting carbon dioxide emissions, having reliable tools to understand forest dynamics is essential.</description>
