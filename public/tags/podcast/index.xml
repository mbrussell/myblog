      <description>The end of the year is an excellent time to reflect on your work. One of the things I value is providing content that the forest analytics community enjoys and learns from.&#xA;In addition to publishing a weekly-ish newsletter on LinkedIn with 2,000+ subscribers, I published 22 posts to the Arbor Custom Analytics blog in 2023 on topics relating to data and forests. Here are the most read posts from the Arbor Custom Analytics blog in 2023:</description>

      <description>The MeatEater podcast.&#xD;The MeatEater Podcast is one of the most widely listened to podcasts in the outdoor genre. It has over 33,000 ratings on Apple Podcasts and consistently ranks as one of the most downloaded podcasts in the outdoors and wilderness categories.&#xA;I’m a semi-regular listener and enjoy the questions from listeners, hunting stories, and discussions on conservation issues. For a podcast that talks about the outdoors so much, I’ve always found it lacks a discussion on forests, one of the ecosystems that the MeatEater crew spends so much time in.</description>
