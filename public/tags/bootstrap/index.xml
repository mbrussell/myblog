      <description>In one of the first presentations I gave as a graduate student, I discussed a set of regression equations that fit a nonlinear model predicting a forest growth index for several species. As all graduate students do, I spent considerable time preparing my slides and practicing my talk. The presentation went well.&#xA;I used a data splitting approach in my analysis that I presented on, a common technique that trains a model on a large portion of the data (usually around 70%) then tests it on a smaller portion of data not used in model fitting (usually around 30%).</description>
