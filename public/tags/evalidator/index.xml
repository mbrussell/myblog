      <description>If you work with forestry data across the United States, youâ€™ve probably had to turn to Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data at one time or another to look at the status and trends in our forest resources. The FIA database has information contained from over 130,000 forest inventory plots across the country.&#xA;One of the tools that analysts often use to access FIA data is the the EVALIDator web interface.</description>

      <description>The US national forest inventory has information contained from over 130,000 forest inventory plots across the country. Data collected and maintained by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program are needed for answering core forestry questions, and having the right tools to help extract specific data that fits the analysis is essential.&#xA;After attending the FIA Science Stakeholder Meeting last week, I was happy to learn about some important updates to two tools that are widely used by forest analysts: the FIA EVALIDator program and the FIA DataMart.</description>
