      <description>At the start of the pandemic in 2020, I was worried. Not just for the serious global health impacts, but also for the workload I would soon be faced with.&#xA;I taught an introductory statistics course for graduate students in the natural resources and agricultural disciplines, and was scrambling to find out how I would migrate my course material to an online, asynchronous format.&#xA;At the same time, I was searching for a different textbook to use for the course.</description>

      <description>The Homeland Security Department recently recognized forestry as a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline. Homeland Security has added both the general forestry and forest resources production and management fields of study to the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program.&#xA;This is significant for the forestry profession because colleges and universities will have access to additional funding to support students. The announcement also makes it easier for non US citizens with advanced degrees (such as Masters and PhD graduates) that are in STEM disciplines to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States.</description>
