      <description>Word cloud for the Climate 21 Project Transition Memo-Department of Agriculture.
There&amp;rsquo;s a transition coming to the White House, and forests and climate change will be a large part of it.
In late 2020, the Climate 21 Project drafted a series of transition memos highlighting recommendations and opportunities related to climate change and the federal government&amp;rsquo;s response. The Climate 21 Project includes the insights of over 150 experts with government expertise related to climate change.</description>

Arbor Custom Analytics recently worked with the Forest Resources Association to create a series of fact sheets at the state, region, and national level.</description>
