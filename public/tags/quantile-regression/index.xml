      <description>Example output comparing predictions from three models fit with linear quantile mixed models and one fit using ordinary least squares.&#xD;Mixed models have been used for decades by forest biometricians and statisticians. They have become popular because forestry and natural resources data are often nested, allowing the analyst to account for spatial and temporal correlation among measurements. Forest plots are often measured within stands, stands are located within ownerships, and a collection of ownerships comprise a landscape.</description>

      <description>Logging trucks wait to be weighed before dropping off their loads of wood. (Photo: Jamey Malcomb/Pine Journal)&#xA;How important are wait times for loggers and truckers?&#xD;Wood procurement managers and suppliers are both interested in reducing the wait times (or turn times) of wood deliveries. Wait times are defined as the time required for trucks to scale in and out when wood is delivered to a mill.&#xA;Both wood procurement managers and their suppliers need to know when wait times exceed the amount of time they expect.</description>
