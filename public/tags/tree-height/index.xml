      <description>The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in 2022.&#xD;One of my favorite things about the holiday season is the Rockefeller Christmas tree.

Many foresters will sub-sample tree heights, for example only measuring the heights for every fifth tree or the four closest trees to plot center.</description>
