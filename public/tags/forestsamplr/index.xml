      <description>Forest inventories that measure carbon, like any forest attribute, are conducted to obtain a precise estimate of a population mean. Forest carbon inventories can cost a lot of time and effort. Their high costs have been cited as a barrier for some landowners to enter carbon programs.&#xA;Until remote sensing technologies are adopted at scale to monitor and report carbon, field based inventories will continue to be relied on the estimate forest carbon and their associated attributes.</description>

      <description>&#xD;This workshop for Tag Ng showcased how sampling and statistics can be used in forestry applications. The two-hour virtual workshop discussed common sampling design used in forestry and statistical approaches with forest inventory data. Example coding sessions used the forestsamplr and tidymodels packages in R.&#xA;VIEW SLIDES&#xD;VIEW R CODE AND DATA&#xD;</description>

      <description>Tools for estimating population means for stratified and simple random samples&#xD;If we know the size of a number of subpopulations that are a part of a larger population, we can use stratified random sampling to come up with a more precise estimate of a population mean. If these subpopulations, or strata, have different mean values and smaller variances relative to the population mean, stratified random sampling is generally preferred over simple random sampling.</description>
