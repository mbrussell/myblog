      <description>I was inspired after reading an article written by Lloyd Irland in The Northern Logger (January 2024) about the upswings and downswings in lumber prices in the last several decades. High prices for lumber were recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic when everybody was remodeling and installing new wooden decks with all the free time they had. The intricacies of lumber prices are explained well in Lloyd’s article. An interesting observation is that during times of high lumber prices, the amount of money landowners received for selling their wood (termed stumpage in forestry parlance) barely nudged.</description>

      <description>Guest workers regenerating a northern Minnesota forest. (photo: @Chris_KTDunham, Twitter)&#xD;Guest workers hired through the H-2B visa program get jobs done. This is especially true across many forestry companies. Guest workers plant trees, clear brush, conduct vegetation management, and assist in tree nursery production.&#xA;A strong guest worker program can lead to a future forest products industry that is healthy and sustainable in the long term. The H-2B program organized through the US Department of Labor provides opportunities to hire temporary foreign workers to fill low-skill and non-agricultural positions.</description>

      <description>Forests and timberlands have long been popular investments that provide returns comparable to other economy-wide measures. The changing private ownership patterns in US forests over the last several decades, as timberlands have been owned or managed by timber investment management organizations or real estate investment trusts, has led to a rise in the benefits of timberland as an investment.&#xA;The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) recently posted fourth quarter and annual returns for their Timberland Index, an index representing 464 investment-grade timberland properties with a market value of $24.</description>

      <description>Log truck (photo: Darin Oswald)&#xA;“To solve any problem in forestry, first figure out where the roads will go.”&#xA;That’s a quote I’ve heard a retired university professor tell students a number of times. There is a lot of wisdom in it: many forest resources are located in remote areas. Hauling products from the woods to the mill can be challenging. The economics of utilizing wood becomes less appealing if forest products are located far away from the mill that processes it.</description>

      <description>Logging companies in the US Lake States requested $49.7 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans offered through the Small Business Administration in 2020 and 2021. These loans were offered to 1,445 logging businesses in the Lake States.&#xA;The SBA Paycheck Protection Program provides information on PPP loan distributions to businesses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Depending on the size of the business and its needs, loan amounts varied.&#xA;For all logging businesses, the average loan amount was $34,412 and there were an average of 3.</description>

      <description>Trees and forests sequester carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This makes them a natural climate solution. This also encourages managers to quantify carbon attributes along with the myriad of other benefits that forests provide.&#xA;The value of carbon in forests has seen a tremendous increase in recent years. The increased role of forests in meeting climate challenges has required analysts to have a better understanding of carbon attributes in the forests they work in.</description>

      <description>In Cabinet Battle #1, one of the most popular songs from the musical Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson discuss the role of the federal government in assuming the financial debt of states. It’s the late 1780s, and Hamilton has ideas for a national bank that Jefferson and many Southerners aren’t fans of.&#xA;Near the end of Hamilton’s verse, he states that it’s odd to take “civics lessons from a slaver”.</description>

      <description>Summary&#xD;The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) offered loans to businesses to provide a direct incentive for them to keep their workers on payroll. Forest products companies across the US received $4.7 billion in PPP loans offered through the Small Business Administration. Over 34,000 loans were offered to forest products companies in the US from April 2020 through May 2021, affecting 485,000 workers in the forest industry.&#xA;The Paycheck Protection Program&#xD;The US Small Business Administration (SBA) managed the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) between April 2020 and May 2021.</description>

      <description>To understand any industry, an analyst should be well acquainted with the codes designating the North American Industry Classification Systems. These NAICS codes are often used along with economic data to analyze an industry or sector. When a new business is created, they self-select into one or more NAICS codes.&#xA;In forestry, there are several designations that represent different areas of the forest products industry. These range from wood products manufacturers, loggers, pulp mills, and forest nurseries.</description>

      <description>The forest products industry relies on wood, a renewable and sustainable raw material. The industry is a top ten manufacturing employer. A few other insights on the importance of the forest products industry:&#xA;250 companies comprise the pulp, paper, and paperboard mill industry in the US,&#xD;The US forest products industry generates 5% of the manufacturing GDP ($169 billion),&#xD;The US forest products industry contains over 22,000 manufacturing facilities (~5,000 pulp and paper and 17,000 wood products)&#xD;56% of US forests are privately owned by family forest owners and companies.</description>

      <description>A forest products company may not always require a precise numeric answer to solve a problem. Oftentimes, understanding a pattern and how data are clustered can suffice.&#xA;The benefit of using pattern recognition techniques is that data need not be labeled prior to analyzing them. In contrast to statistical techniques like regression and classification, identifying patterns can unearth new trends in how data are arranged in your organization.&#xA;Clustering is an unsupervised ML algorithm that groups items.</description>
