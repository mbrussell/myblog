      <description>Often I think that if the numbers behind forest carbon estimates were easier to calculate and interpret, we’d all have a better understanding of the carbon stored and sequestered in our forests. It starts simple when we say that “half of the biomass of a tree is carbon”. But beyond that, transitions between gases and solids and conversions between metric and English units quickly add complexity.
The true amount of forest carbon is only measured in detailed research studies, yet we discuss carbon stocks like they’re known values.</description>

      <description>Drought conditions in the western US, 20 July 2021. From US Drought Monitor.
Much of the western United States is currently under severe drought conditions. Drought impacts trees and forests in the short and long term. Trees and forests can tolerate some extended dry periods depending of species and local conditions, but without adequate moisture availability, drought can ultimately lead to tree mortality.
Perhaps the greatest impact of drought is the stress it places on trees.</description>
