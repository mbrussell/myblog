      <description>Image created with DALL·E 3.&#xD;Two years ago I wrote about the different R packages that are available to use in forestry applications. Back then, there were 16,166 packages archived on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Today, the CRAN repository contains 20,102 packages.&#xA;The power of R comes from its diversity of packages. A package is a collection of functions and data sets developed by R users. The value of using R packages is that someone else might have already written a suite of functions for you.</description>

      <description>I recently watched the video “Teaching the tidyverse in 2023” by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel to learn more about recent changes to my favorite R package. I learned quite a bit of new tricks and techniques for my everyday R coding and sharing a few of them here.&#xA;I’ll use the elm data set from the stats4nr package as I work through a few examples in the post. This data set contains observations on 333 cedar elm trees (Ulmus crassifolia Nutt.</description>

      <description>Example output comparing predictions from three models fit with linear quantile mixed models and one fit using ordinary least squares.&#xD;Mixed models have been used for decades by forest biometricians and statisticians. They have become popular because forestry and natural resources data are often nested, allowing the analyst to account for spatial and temporal correlation among measurements. Forest plots are often measured within stands, stands are located within ownerships, and a collection of ownerships comprise a landscape.</description>

      <description>The cover of a document titled “Statistics in Natural Resources: Applications with R: Exercise Soultions.”&#xD;A few years ago I completed the RStudio Instructor training course. It was a multi-day, online training workshop and I learned less about the ins and outs of coding and analysis in R, but more about the strategies and philosophy of teaching data science principles.&#xA;The course prepares instructors to teach the principles of the tidyverse, especially drawing on the concepts for the excellent book R for Data Science.</description>

      <description>An example use of alt text for a scatterplot made in R, with description of the scatterplot provided by the BrailleR package below the graph.&#xD;You might have seen these prompts while you’re uploading an image to social media or anywhere else on the internet: “Add alt text here.” Alt text describes what’s contained in an image or figure on a webpage. It’s useful because it can be used by screen readers for visually impaired people.</description>

      <description>If you use R software for your data analysis, you are likely familiar with the tidyverse. The tidyverse package is a “megapackage” in R that includes several packages that import, reshape, and visualize data in a consistent manner, among other tasks.&#xA;Like many analysts, I use the tidyverse suite of functions often for importing, wrangling, and visualizing data. More and more I’m using the tidymodels package to apply statistical modeling techniques like regression and random forests on data I work with.</description>

      <description>Being an excellent data analyst requires you to understand the techniques that go into analyzing data and how to communicate them effectively. While having a foundation in statistics and the quantitative sciences is essential, the most effective data analysts communicate information that influences decision makers.&#xA;Unfortunately, there are plenty of examples of sloppy data analyses that distort the reality of what data can tell us. As an example, genetics researchers have found that Microsoft Excel’s autocorrecting feature had led to errors in 30% of gene list observations over a six year span.</description>

      <description>A meme about p-values. Hat tip to Matt Dancho for the idea for the graphic.&#xD;The statistics community has had a lot of discussion in recent years about the role of p-values and statistical significance. This has led some to question if we’re relying too much on them as a way of interpreting results from a statistical analysis.&#xA;The “p” in p-value stands for probability, or the probability under a statistical model that a summary of the data would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value.</description>

      <description>You might have heard this before: “I just saw the largest X tree in the state!”&#xA;I have always been curious about the trees that make the list of state tree champions, or “big trees”. For nearly every state in the US, a list of the largest trees of each species are maintained. As landowners and foresters roam the woods, they can report a potential champion tree. (For context, in 2018 a team of wildlife researchers came across the largest jack pine in the US when they were studying wolves in northern Minnesota.</description>

      <description>If you’re like me, you work with a lot of data files in your daily analytical work. Despite the increase in cloud computing, reading in files locally to the machine your working on is common.&#xA;You want a rapid summary of your data and don’t want to wait forever for your computer to read in the file you’re working with. To do this, you want to use functions that are efficient and effective for working with large amounts of data.</description>

      <description>The R program is one of the most popular programs being used by forest analysts today. Forest analysts use R packages, or collections of functions and data sets, to help guide their everyday work.&#xA;Last year I wrote about 31 R packages available to forest analysts available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) package repository. For perspective, as of today CRAN has archived 18,732 packages since 2006.&#xA;R users also make packages available on GitHub, particularly for specific disciplines like forest inventory and measurements.</description>

      <description>Random forests have quickly become one of the most popular analytical techniques used in forestry today. Random forests (RF) are a machine learning technique that differ in many ways to traditional prediction models such as regression. Random forests can handle a lot of data, can be applied to classification or regression problems, and rank the relative importance of many variables that are related to a response variable of interest.</description>

      <description>As a part of my work with the University of Minnesota Extension, we run the Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer program. The AVID program engages citizen scientists to monitor tree seedlings that are susceptible to browse from white-tailed deer. With little information on deer browse impacts for most of Minnesota’s tree species, the data are beginning to provide insights on how deer browse degrades the health of the forest.</description>

      <description>Photo by Chris Liverani on Unsplash.&#xA;The standard deviation measures the dispersion of individual samples around a mean value. It is one of the most useful measures in forestry and natural resources because it quantifies the “noise” in a sample of data.&#xA;When I was learning statistics in an introductory course, I was shown a formula to approximate the standard deviation. Rather than needing to calculate how far each observation was from the mean value, a key component of the standard deviation calculation, this formula only required knowing the largest and smallest value in the data.</description>

      <description>Myself and a team of coauthors recently submitted a manuscript that analyzed forest composition data from a silvicultural study. Here is a comment from a peer reviewer that reviewed the work:&#xA;“I would like the authors to justify not using mixed models or to change their analyses for mixed models.”&#xA;The comment urged us to reevaluate the analysis of the data. Ultimately we redid the analysis using a mixed model framework, instead of using the traditional analysis of variance approach taught in many introductory statistics classes.</description>

      <description>After we conduct a survey, we have a routine for analyzing the data. Summarize the numerical responses and report values like means for specific questions. Group the data into different demographics and report the means within these categories.&#xA;If we ask for any qualitative data through comments (e.g., “What is your opinion of X?”), the responses are always worth reading. We often get a lot of insight from reading an individual’s comments, and these comments can unveil new dimensions of our analysis.</description>

      <description>Loggers are the backbone of the forest products industry and contribute to the 2.5 million jobs in the US that forests provide. Despite their importance to the industry, many studies have highlighted the challenges that loggers face with regard to economic markets, changing demographics, and an unhealthy outlook on the profession.&#xA;As an example in Minnesota, a recent study indicated that the average age of logging businesses continues to grow older, with a third of loggers more than 60 years old.</description>
