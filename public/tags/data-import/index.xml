      <description>I used to cringe every time I needed to import Forest Inventory and Analysis data. The data files that contain tree observations for a single state can exceed 100 megabytes. The file I downloaded six months ago might or might not contain the most recent data for that state.
There are a few R packages that have been developed in the last several years that help import FIA data.</description>

      <description>If youâ€™re like me, more of the data you use on a daily basis are stored in Google Sheets. You might be using fewer Excel spreadsheets and .csv files. I recently researched the most up-to-date ways to import data from an Access database into R. (It had been a while since I imported data from a database.)
Using Google Sheets to store data has several advantages:
Multiple people can collaborate on the same data set,Information entered into a Google Form can populate data in a Google Spreadsheet,Data can be accessed and edited both online and offline, andGoogle Sheets can be converted to Excel spreadsheets, and vice versa.</description>
