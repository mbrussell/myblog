The Forest Carbon Cheat Sheet is a quick reference guide for converting forest carbon measurements and understanding typical carbon values at the tree, stand, and landscape levels. 

The Cheat Sheet has been updated with the most recent values published in the US Environmental Protection Agency [Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2020](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2020).
