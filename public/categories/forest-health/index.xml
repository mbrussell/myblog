      <description>Drought conditions in the western US, 20 July 2021. From US Drought Monitor.&#xA;Much of the western United States is currently under severe drought conditions. Drought impacts trees and forests in the short and long term. Trees and forests can tolerate some extended dry periods depending of species and local conditions, but without adequate moisture availability, drought can ultimately lead to tree mortality.&#xA;Perhaps the greatest impact of drought is the stress it places on trees.</description>
