      <description>Tell me if this has ever happened to you.
You’re taking a walk or you’re on a run in the dark, and you have a headlamp on. It’s raining or snowing - not too hard, but enough to make your time outside a little uncomfortable.

Sometimes we are required in a grant to provide a talk via a presentation about our research to the public.</description>
