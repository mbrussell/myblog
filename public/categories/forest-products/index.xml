      <description>I was inspired after reading an article written by Lloyd Irland in The Northern Logger (January 2024) about the upswings and downswings in lumber prices in the last several decades. High prices for lumber were recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic when everybody was remodeling and installing new wooden decks with all the free time they had. The intricacies of lumber prices are explained well in Lloyd’s article. An interesting observation is that during times of high lumber prices, the amount of money landowners received for selling their wood (termed stumpage in forestry parlance) barely nudged.</description>

      <description>Screenshot of the forest products and pandemic funding application.&#xD;Forest products companies used the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Pandemic Assistance for Timber Harvesters and Haulers (PATHH) programs to keep nearly 500,000 workers in the US forest industry on payroll throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A new web application is now available that summarizes these pandemic assistance programs and funding provided to each individual state.&#xA;You can access the web app here.</description>

      <description>Harvested wood products store carbon in many different forms. Increasingly, forest carbon programs are available to diverse forest landowners, and harvested wood products that result from enrolled properties need to be counted. These slides were presented at the Linkiwood 2023 Wood Tech Leadership Summit on Nov. 30, 2023.&#xA;READ THE SLIDES HERE.&#xA;WATCH THE RECORDING (18:09) on YouTube.</description>

      <description>Forests and timberlands have long been popular investments that provide returns comparable to other economy-wide measures. The changing private ownership patterns in US forests over the last several decades, as timberlands have been owned or managed by timber investment management organizations or real estate investment trusts, has led to a rise in the benefits of timberland as an investment.&#xA;The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) recently posted fourth quarter and annual returns for their Timberland Index, an index representing 464 investment-grade timberland properties with a market value of $24.</description>

      <description>Many states provide information on stumpage prices for commonly harvested timber species. This information provides land managers and landowners a sense of what current prices are for different timber species, products, and regions throughout a state.&#xA;The Maine Forest Service (MFS) collects data on timber sales through a notification process when timber sales occur. The last report from MFS contains over 1,600 reports from landowners that conducted a timber sale in 2020.</description>

      <description>Carbon is stored and sequestered in growing forests. It can also can be stored “off site” in the form of harvested wood products. These can be in short-lived products (i.e., paper or pulp) or long-lived ones (i.e., utility poles).&#xA;Harvested wood products in use and solid waste disposal sites (e.g., landfills) represent 4.5% of the total amount of carbon in the US. When using wood products, lower emissions are used compared fossil fuel-intensive materials such as steel and concrete.</description>
